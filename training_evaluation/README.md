- automated_internal_external_scoring_CV_clean.ipynb was used to train with leave-one-dataset out crossvalidation. This code saves the model and predictions on leftout data for  each CV fold
   - Data used for training this model cannot be shared, so a synthetic dataset is provided. 
- plots_clean.py was used to take the predictions on the left-out sets and make the plots in the paper.
